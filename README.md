When I was a kid

Time is man-made but space isn't. It was a dark and stormy night. The windows were frosty and the winds were harsh. It was just me and my dad living together. We lived together in a two-story house, placed closely to the king of the demi-humans himself. My dad was a prestigious and upper noble man that was gifted with a house. Living in our kingdom wasn't easy.  Food was severely scarce which led to our population dying out. However, we had plenty of fruits and vegetables in our home garden. We'd even rarely be offered fish and meat requested from the king of Demis himself, using the trade market between us demi-humans and humans. My Father owned a house that was bigger than the rest, and some of the kids would even joke about it. They would call me spoiled, a wimp, or conceited. On their really bad days I was a spoiled wimp that's conceited, but in all honesty I never really asked for much. Actually, I never really cared for interest in anything really. My father was known to be one of the strongest and the most nice in the land. But I could never see it. How can such an over optimistic person like my old man be given all of this? You could hear whistles through the trees when standing from my living room windows, as my dad lectured me about magic school. I hated hearing him repeatedly tell me about how great magic school is, as if I was a magic demi-human ticking bomb. I felt like it was engraved unto me. Or, maybe I was too young and didn't realize how great this man truly was.

"Happy 12th Birthday Son, I am so grateful for having a well behaved and talented child."
  My dad and I were in the living room. I was studying for school, wrapping up getting ready for bed. While my dad was gearing up getting ready to take off for his usual night run. He'd sometimes say a few words before he left and this just so happened to be one of those times..
"Your teacher said if you keep it up in class she may just have you teach the class for her." 
" Haha, could you believe that!"
"Wait, when did you guys talk about me dad?"
"Ahem, Just make sure you study hard.
He picked up a photo of him and his old friends in magic school and made a grin.
"Wow time sure does fly by fast."
He 
"In four more years you'll be sixteen, and then you'll be ready to enroll in magic school."
"And, just for this special occasion I had brought you a special gift and I think you'll like it."
"Sorry to break it to you dad but your gifts are usually old and practical, not really up my alley."
"Remember the first magic book you gave me, was only a list of cleaning spells."
"Hey, you don't know how hard it was finding one of those."
"Yup, they don't make them like they used to."
"These used to be a must living in my school dorms."
"Well, we'll just see what you got for me this year I guess."
"When I return home, I will be positive you'll love it."
"So, what's this mission all about, is the king having you dig holes in the rain?"
"No, we heard there were a couple of guys killing cattle in our farms and leaving. 
"So, Joshua and I have been put on duty for the night since those damn humans are too lazy to do anything."
"I guess some things never change do they."
"But, no matter, I do love what I do."
As he gave the smirk he always gives every time he leaves on his missions. 
"Hmph, I just hope you double layered and brought extra socks." 
"The mud isn't the only thing you'll need to worry about, hahaha." 
"you're right, haha, keep that up and you're on your way kid!", my dad echoed. 
I had no clue what he was talking about. I made my way upstairs but before then he yelled.
"I love you and mud!" 
Then he exited the room. That last time I would see him. The last thing I remember hearing was the door shut, and a clicking noise as he locked it behind him. Me, not knowing this was the last time, slept as if the days would never change.



I'm in a room surrounded by total darkness and all I see are people in black tunics using the darkness from the hood to mask their faces. That's when I knew it had to be a dream. I've seen these guys numerous times before, and I always thought of it as only a recurring nightmare. But, this was different. They would usually sit stationary alongside a long black metal table with a white light over them and I'd be forced to watch them. I could never get the urge to tell anyone as if it was for the best or something. Still, this dream was different, way different. They were all staring at me this time, as if they knew I was there. It felt cold as if the environment was tangible. I could feel my legs and feet begin to get heavier and weaker. This felt a little too real. 
"He's finally here sir" whispered from the group.
"Hmm it appears so."
His voice was so deep I could feel it vibrate my hairs. He then walked away from them to me and proceeded to stick out his hand. Afterwards, he just pointed at me.

"Do you seek power, boy?" 

"You understand where you are standing?"

I couldn't move or look away, just speechless.

"Well, do you?" 

"Will you stand tall and mighty or be the foundation we laugh at and you people pity so much." 

"What if I told you, you were special." 

"Yeah, nothing like your sorry and pitiful father.

"But you have the power of great opportunities, haha."

"How do you know of my Father?" 

"I know everything, and your father was nothing but a pest."

"You will understand sooner or later what you want and what will happen."

"So, let's play a game haha."

"Let anybody know of our little encounter and it is game over for that guy, hahaha."

"Now let us begin, shall we?

"Phillip, wake up!", a voice cried.

"This is no time to sleep, wake your ass up!", Exclaimed from beyond my bed.

There stood Joshua. A tall Black half human half rabbit looking man. A mighty warrior, who was said to have taken an entire band of ogres pillaging a village. And, it was said he did it without any weapons, just hands. There he stood beside Phillip's bed. His facial expression was so serious, not even the gods could move him from carrying out his most difficult task. 

"Uncle Josh?"

"What are you doing here?"

"Where's my dad!" 

Each sentence, getting more and more clear as I'm still trying to fully awaken from my dream. 

"Right now I am Joshua Ford Hart, and as of today your father James Anthony Holland is pronounced dead by the Safeguard Knights of the Demi-Humans."

"You're, you're kidding me right?"

"Please tell me this is a sick joke or something, he was just here last night?"

"Why are you still alive, how could you dare leave him!"

"You're a fool and you guys are the worst and…"

Then Joshua turns around to show me what seems to be big deep cuts on his back. It looked like all the blood around his cuts turned to a murky green acid. And, if you would have touched it your fingers were to have dissolved.

"I wanted to help, but he told me he would rather fight this one alone.", Joshua said in sorrow.

"There were two of them and even so I still held my ground." 

"We tried to hold them off, but these guys were different from anything I have ever battled"

"I couldn't make out there moves, like I was a sitting eel duck."

"Nothing prepared me for that battle, and while your dad held both of them off,  he told me to make a break for it."

"One tried to kill me as I turned my back but your father stopped them."

"I've never seen a man so determined, he fought extraordinary"

"Your father was a truly an amazing friend, brother, and subordinate."

"Who did this to him!?", I screamed.

"That information is strictly classified and I can't tell you?"

"Was it the guys in the black cloaks and tunics?"

"Phillip, where exactly did you learn of this?"

"Nowhere, just tell me!"

"Listen, there are some things kids are just too young and have no business being in."

"You should learn to keep it to the grown-ups."

"What you are talking about is something nobody should know. 

"It would be best if you would keep that little comment between us"

"This is crazy, I finally learned how to brew potions."
"I'll just find him and blow him up," I said rationally.
"Phillip, do you seriously think that would work?"

"I'm not sure but I know I'm not going to just stand here like you while someone I care about is gone!"

"Phillip, look if you truly want to be stronger I suggest you join the magic school and learn what magic abilities you have."

"Look, your father gave me this."
It was a black rod, four feet and as thick as a quarter, with white writing inscribed saying: There's always a time and a place, it's whether or not it matters. 

"This was the weapon he used to fight with."

"He said that he was going to give it to you today for your birthday, I almost couldn't believe it."

"Although it seems to be inactive now and useless, I'm sure you can make use of it somehow."

Joshua tosses the rod towards me and I catch it with no hesitation. Me clenching tightly onto what I had left of him.

"He wanted you to keep it safe until you go to school for him."

"Dad!" I cried out as my day officially marked as the worst.

"I swear on your father's grave I will take you under my care and shape you to become a great man, but that's only if you want to."

"Of Course!" 
I was determined at this point. My eyes tearing into space ready to kill those guys.
"Haha, maybe you are your father's kid."
















	
Magic School

It was hard without my father. He died from an accident, which led my uncle to adopting me. I didn’t talk to anyone for half a year. Uncle Joshua, at first, would knock every morning to ask if I would want to workout with him. I had refused his offer. I just sat there in my room, hopelessly. Then, I remembered something. A promise I made to myself when my father had passed. To become a strong knight like him. So, for the next remaining year and a half, uncle and I would workout every other morning. And, every night I would be given homework to finish. Though he suggested I wait like everyone to learn advanced magic, I am aware of my ability to manipulate fire like my father.

	“show us your fire power” says a girl named Susie Baker sitting from her desk in the front.
	“I um, my fire power isn’t all that big when compared to my uncle Josh hehe.
	“Calm down girly"
            "You guys will all be able to show off your powers as soon as your teacher arrives shall we all wait here together.'' says the man who instructed us to our seats.
	“Now, Phillip I believe, you may sit down now”
            "Uh, yeah, sure."
	“Wait one second, I could see feathers on this guy's neck!”, shouts Vincent Marseille Espinoza
	“I can’t believe it, they’ll let anyone join this school.”
	“I’m sorry but who exactly are you supposed to be?”, I instantly interjected. 
	“Why, I am the Nephew of our beloved king, and next general in line, as people say.”
	“And, I don’t need any Demi-fodder getting in my way of success.”
	“I’m sorry, but I can care less what you think, you obviously have some issues going on.”
	“Guwah?? you dare speak to me as if I, Vincent Marseille Espinoza, is on the same level as you?”
	“Dude I just wanna sit down, is that ok your all powerfulness?”
	“Just don’t get in my way, Fodder, and I might spare you.”
	“Sir Vincent, we have been working with the demi-humans for some time now and your uncle insisted we try to enroll more of them,'' responds the instructor.
	“Pshh, my uncle will be the death of this country.”
	“My father should have ruled over this country”
	“How could you say that about our king, you are such an ass Vincent”, yells Megan Caprice
	A beautiful girl. No, the most beautiful girl in our class. She was able to manipulate fierce wind magic, but however she couldn’t control it.
	“Please Megan, everybody in this class may fall for your cuteness and trickery but I’m way stronger.”
	“Or nuts!” yelled at by someone randomly in the room.
	“Vincent I swear you talk too much, I’ll blow you across the four great human colonies.
	“I like to see you try bitch!”
            Things really started to boil. I wasn't sure if going to a human school was smart in the first place. This wasn't exactly what I was expecting.
	“Now now class, let us calm down,'' says the instructor as he tries to stop the fued
	“If not you definitely won’t like what’s in store next.”
	“He’ll be here shortly, this will be his first time teaching so let us hope he goes easy on all of you haha.”
	Yup, this was magic school. It was huge, standing at five stories tall. I heard each floor contains a different facility, helping our class grow and get stronger. And, at the top, there contains all of the faculty members and administrators that help manage and shape our school for our future. There were a couple famous guys who set the bar in the world that went to this school including my dad and Uncle Josh. The place was so big some of the things it had to offer were two stadiums, two pools, one for indoors and the other for outdoors, a huge cafeteria with a variety of foods, stables for a few exotic animals they kept enclosed, and other things I heard of but yet to see. It seemed the work I submitted to enroll in the southern magic school was successfully approved. I passed with an eighty-eight percent and was barely qualified to join. There were only 16 students in our class. Four in which passed by grades. And,  I guess it’s very hard to be accepted unless you pass with a 90 or above. Either that or you are gifted with an extraordinary power which ranks you amongst the best. People that don’t pass will go on to live a normal life. Whether it’s farming if you are strong, to being a banker with high knowledge in studies or good physical health. Everything seemed truly established in the Human Society. I couldn’t help but feel more out of place than ever.

	“Everyone prepare for battle!!” yelled from beyond the door.
Instantly my classmates started to panic in chaos, some ready for whatever was to come. I was completely shocked from the crowd as they simultaneously fled to the back. 

“Is this really happening?” yelled a student tugging on the instructors shirt.
	“Don’t panic students, you all should stay calm.”
 “Remember we are the Holy Knights of Human society, I’m sure this is nothing.”
“Hey, Priscilla, If we all die right now at this moment, I want you to know, I love you!” says a classmate with shaded glasses.
“Aww thank you I appreciate it hun.” says Priscilla trying not to feel awkward.
“Yo Joseph you got balls, this is my dad right here!”  says Jeison 
Joseph had black long hair and seemed pretty fit compared to the others but he was no taller than me.
“Haha, this class is great! I said”
	“What are you laughing at peasant, you know you have no business being here.”
	“You’re the one confessing your love on the first day, haha try to relax a bit.”
	“What was that demi?”
	“Please, shut up you fools and watch as I, Vincent Marseille Espinoza, handle these low lives.”
	Then, in an instance there standing at the door was none other than Uncle Joshua. Standing tall and mighty like a statue but his fur white as snow. 
	“Hello class, I am Joshua Ford Hart, former captain of The Safeguard Knight of The Demi-Humans.”
	“Are you kidding me a freaking rabbit? They’re turning this place into a zoo!”
	“I shall not tolerate this for any longer, I demand to be transferred this instant!”
	“Sorry Vincent your father and the king told me about how you felt directly and said this would be most healthy for you as we bridge the gap between our nations”
	“With that being said either you join or you will be expelled from all magic schools.”
            “Oh, ahem. I’m actually a bunny by the way, thank you.”
	“Uuh I swear one day you shall witness what it is to be human!” as Vincent sat at his desk.
	“Well now, like I was saying when I was yelling for a fun introduction.”
	“Everyone, prepare for battle!”
	“We will be separating into two teams from a premade list we've based off your guys' resume.”
	I was in a stand still as I couldn’t believe he was going to be my teacher. I felt kind of glad that I wasn’t going to be as lonely after all.

	“Phillip!” Joshua called
	“Show them how to produce a fireball.”
	“Uh, ok Uncle Josh.”

           I remember back then burning my hands trying to learn how to make fire by myself. My hands engulfed in flames for a good few seconds. However I felt like it was minutes. Then it came to me there was a book of fire magic my dad kept in his study room. There was something containing different types of fire, and depending on the color of flames there’s a different meaning. I remember the color of fire negation was green. So I Imagined a green flame coating my skin, acting as protection against fire. I thought this would be a good time to show everyone what I studied all these years and the color was neat. Plus, this won't hurt anyone.
            I seen and by the way Phillip please call me Sir Ford hart.”
            “Oh ok, Sir Ford Hart”
            Then I did a fireball with ease. The flames were a dark green getting lighter as it layers out. The light almost gave the room a stigma like feeling as if everyone saw me as a freak now.
             “What kind of fire is that, are you a defect of some sorts?” says Suterusu Nashi.
             He’s a wanna be ninja I heard.
             “Wow Phillip you learned how to use fire resistance spells.” Sir Ford Hart said in amazement.
	“That's some higher class magic you won't be learning until a few months from now, how did you learn to conjure such spells?”
	I knew I couldn't tell him of my secret training outside of school but if I didn't, then I wouldn't be able to grow. So, I told him only what he needed to know. Remembering that I still have a mission to fulfill I was honest as possible. 
	“I learned it by reading my father’s old books.”
	“I would sneak his books while I studied yours.”
	“I am sorry for going behind your back.”
	“Now Phillip, where in class and that was quite a performance you put out there I feel the class in whole would be surprised at what we all can do.”
	“Before we start let’s have everyone Introduce they’re name and magic abilities as a fun first assignment.”
             “Since we all saw enough of Phillip let’s start with you Mr. Vincent.”
             “Finally you share the spotlight with me, probably the smartest decision you ever made now watch as I dazzle you with my magic.” Vincent said eagerly as he headed in front of the classroom.
“Now do you fear me” Vincent yelled as his voice echoed
There in front of the class we see two of him perfectly identical as if he multiplied. The whole class was amazed.
“What the hell dude, how do we fight this?” One kid said beyond the class
“I’m not even done yet”
Then there stood Vincent behind the same guy recently talking. The other body is still remaining at the front desk.
 “Wow I’m impressed by your spatial magic Vincent, I’m sure you’ll be a magnificent mage” Sir Ford Hart encouraged by his adept skills.”
“Glad we’re on the same page peasant “
“Ok!, next we have here is a miss Priscilla Hemsworth. 
“Don’t scare her this time Joseph haha”  Jeison yelled across the class
“Aww shut the hell up Jeison.” Joseph replied in embarrassment.
	“Alright as of this instant we will be civilized people if you decide to keep interrupting and/or disobey my orders you can consider yourself done here.”
	“This is one of the four great magic schools that is known in vast kingdoms and, so far, how things are looking, you guys may be the lowest of them all.” 
	“So next outburst from anyone, that goes for you too Vincent, would be instantly expelled.”
	“Hmph, as you wish” Vincent said ignorantly.
	“Now carry on Priscilla”
	“Hello, um my name is Priscilla Hemsworth and I possess ice magic.
	“For now I only manipulate it and can't produce it, i'm not sure if its due to the atmospheric pressure of water in the air compared to my magic, thus keeping it from solidifying.”
“Or maybe I'm doing something wrong with the form and chanting art I'm still studying, but I’ll be sure to get back to you guys on that hehe.”
	“But, yeah, I can manipulate ice and freeze things” as she smiled beginning to walk back to her seat.”
	The whole class was in awe as she walked back to her seat. Most of us had no idea what the hell she said.
	“Haha alright maybe we do have some hope, starting to see our star pupil haha” Joshua said laughing.
	“ok, um, next we have here is a mister Zachary Pi Stone.”
	The class became silent as we sat here waiting for someone to introduce himself.
	“Damn it, that's going to make the teams odd if we have a drop out already.” whispered the teacher under his breath.
	“So..so..sorry sir, I am Zachary.” says a short scrawny kid sitting in the back of the class
He and another guy were the only Demi-Humans as a student in the class other than me. He seemed to be half squirrel.
	“Oh, so you must be Zachary, can you demonstrate to the class what your magic attribute will be.”
	“ye.. yeah of course sir!”
            "Tsk" blurted Vincent as he tried his best to stay calm.
	Zachary then pulls out a dead bird from his pocket. Its leg was bent, wing was cut, and had a cracked beak. It was almost painful to look at.
	“Eww how disgusting,” cries out Megan Caprice.
            "Seems the kid brought his lunch from home haha" Vincent jokes eagerly.
            "Vincent one more chance!"
            "Uuugh, sorry sir."
	“Sorry, don't be alarmed guys, this isn't at all my lunch" Zarchary says trying to stop anything else from transpiring.
	That’s when Zachary placed the bird on the teachers desk. Everyone was clueless on what he was about to do, but we all stared him down, motionless and curious. He then placed both hands on the bird, and began to do chants I wasn’t even familiar with. The bird started to glow yellowish orange and soon after the body parts started to heal. The bird then let out chirp before waking up and becoming conscious again. It was almost as if the bird never got hurt. Zachary then opened the window and let the bird fly out. Quickly making its escape as if it was never hurt, and now in a hurry to make its way home. But, we can see Zachery, sweating and standing while holding his head. He seemed very drained as well. It was like the bird had stolen his energy.
	“I come from an ancient bloodline of powerful healers, and that was me transferring my life force to that little birdy just now.” 
	“As of now we’re the only ones that can bring animals back from the dead, but requires a ton of mana drained from me.”
            "And there is a fatal possibility because this spell is specifically linked to your physical life force, which makes it difficult to cast due to the human's absurd amount of stamina drained.
	“But…., I want to be the first person to bring a human back!.”
The whole class stood there quietly. Well, they were all questioning each other if that was even a thing, let alone possible. To bring someone back from the dead was just a dream for some. The only way remotely possible is by retrieving and/or learning ancient items or spells. It's known though that there are limitations and consequences for using such spells. So is it even possible for a person to physically do it? 
           "Hahahaha" the whole class cheers in laughter.
            "You, bring back from the dead!?" Shouts one student.
            "How funny, it seems the little kid grew some guts." Yells another student.
            "It's not funny, I will do it watch me!" Cries Zachary.
             "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!" I yelled, having finally reached everyone's attention. 
I told them off.
            "Are you guys serious?"
            " Do you have no respect whatsoever for your fellow classmates?"
             "We are all students who practice to uphold the future of our kingdoms, and you guys are already downing one of our subordinates!!"
             "You all should be ashamed of yourselves and…"
            "Phillip!, thank you, that would be all." Joshua interjected.
            "You must learn when not to use your tongue before you do it freely." 
            "However class, he's right and it seems we are having trouble still getting along."
            "So, everytime I hear a word when not told to speak you won't be expelled."
            "No actually, far worse than that my kids.
            "You will be forced to write a 50 page essay on the meanings of teamwork."
            "It seems mandatory for some of you, or prove me wrong, whether or not,  I'm not the one that has to do it.
            "Now, do I make myself clear!" 
            "Yes sir!" The class shouted together, everyone's faces turning serious now.
            “Ok, so kid, what do you expect to do with that power once you've obtained it?” Sir Ford Hard asked in seriousness.
            “Who me?" Zachary standing motionless  as if he was just watching an intense battle.
             "You're still up here right, of course you silly."
             "Well uh actually… I plan to bring my family back sir.”
            “With a magic ability like that you may lose more than you’ve gained; Is that a path you’re sure you’re willing to take?”
            “Sir, I’m not sure what you mean, but what I am sure of is that everyday I live my life, I live on for them.”
            “I thought I could pass on our teachings but, there’s only a few of us left, and the ones that are left have already given up entirely.”
            “Everyday I wake up reminded of my people, and as the days go on I could feel my heritage slipping from me.”
            "I wish that someone else stronger was in my place!"
            Wow, I can only imagine how this kid's feeling right now. All alone and probably feels helpless.
            "Poor guy" 
            "I think they couldn't ask for a better person, don't worry about…" Joshua said before being interrupted.
            “But sir, I can say one thing, I'm certain of our people’s abilities.” Zachary says with determination.
His determination was enough to frighten everyone in the classroom. Nobody was expecting him to be so serious. And somehow I couldn't help but feel kinda bad for the guy. Like I can kinda relate to him.
	“A kid with heart, hehe very rare indeed.” Sir Ford Hart said as he placed his hand on his shoulder.
            “You should try and make some friends as well, I think we can all learn something from each other.”
  	“You may sit down now while I call the next person.”
	“Ok so we did Phillip, Vincent, Priscilla, and Zachary so next on the list will be a mister Suterusu Nashi.
	From the dark corner of the classroom a pair of ninja stars was thrown from the middle of the class and hit the teacher's apple on his desk.”
	“Ugh I wasn’t going to eat that anyways it was too close to that dead bird, but I’m guessing you are Mr. Nashi correct?” says Sir Ford Hart.
	Then a smoke bomb explodes in the front and exits Suterusu Nashi. 
	“Yes sir, I felt I needed a flashy appearance like those guys, they were dope.”
            "Dope?" Sir Ford Hart repeated confusingly.
	“No need to be like them just be yourself, and please tell the class who you are.”
	“Oh right haha, I am Suterusu Nashi and I am the best ninja mage, and you can also say uh, the first!” 
            He sounded so vibrant and confident. You could hear as the class tried to hold themselves from laughing. There was no such thing as a ninja mage, let alone an actual ninja. Suterusu Nashi was a slim cool looking dude with Caucasian skin and black slick straight hair. He seemed to not be affected by anyone who disapproves of his choice. Very odd fellow indeed you got to say.
	“And my magic ability is..”
	He then pulled out a katana, the blade was thinner than a strand of hair , but looked very durable. Instantly electricity starts to warp around the blade clearly visible like it was dancing on water.
           “I joined this school to hone my ninja skills and spread my teachings across the land.” 
           “I want to give people a sense of honor and safety.”
           “Ha ha ha people across the land will know me as Nashi Sensei or maybe just Sensei, Sensei sama?”
            “You’ll need to learn a lot before you become a Sensei Mr. Suterusu.” says Sir Ford Hart.
            "What do you mean?"
            “You need to gain more experience and don’t be afraid to be a little creative, that way you can form your own techniques suitable to your style..”
            “Hmm I think I get what you’re saying, thank you Sensei for your valuable teaching!”
            “I figured even though many people die each day their teachings seems to always live on for them”
           “Suterusu, only if you make what’s yours special then will it be your voice for the world, even from beyond.”
            “Yes sir!”

           A black smoke then appears before the class could see Suterusu shed a tear
          “Thank you.” Says Suterusu in a cool like voice.
           “He then reappeared back into the crowd of students.”
            “How does he do that!” Someone shouts in surprise.”
	“Ah, ok here’s a good one!”
            “Next we got here is mister Jeison Brown.”
He was a human of course, who looked skinny with dark skin and short hair. As he began to make his introduction he sounded very quiet.
            “Hello, my name is Jeison.”
            “Hi Jeison, the class replied.
           “I'm 15 and I love cake and look forward to learning with you all.
Jeison then tries to walk back to the class.
           "Hey aren't you gonna demonstrate your magic attribute boy?" Sir Ford Hart said in confusion.
           "Oh uh yeah, sorry. I forgot about that."
Soon then another body separates from his own.
           "Hello, my name is jeison"
           "That's my power!" Yelled Vincent.
           "Vincent, you will be required to turn in your essay before you enter the class tomorrow!."
            "Hmph, so be it" Vincent sneers.
            "Anyone else is more than welcome to join him."
"No?, Jeison please continue now"
"Oh, uh my magic attribute is copy magic." 
"I can copy anything I physically touch alongside a few spells I have learned."
"Hmm how interesting.”
“How does it work?" 
"My mana basically scans the object I touch and analyzes all the data that goes to it, thus dispersing from either hand the copy of that same item."
The class was still having a hard time visualizing. I wasn't sure what they didn't get. 
"Well uh, oh for instance, take a look at this writing stick. "
"So, all I would have to do is channel my mana into the stick like so, and."
      	The writing stick began to glow yellow for a quick instance before dimming. He then took out his other hand 
"Woah!" One student shouted.
"Awesome!" Another student shouted.
"Now look at my right hand"
The stick began materializing in front of our eyes. We wouldn't believe it unless we saw it. It was perfectly identical. 
"Everything may look the same but if you try using it, it'll probably snap."
"I can copy whatever I desire hehe."
"Oh uh, but it significantly becomes weaker, so depending how strong the material is will tell how well it will hold up after being copied."
"Wow, very interesting looking forward to seeing how well you do against the other team."
"Huh? You honestly think my powers are good enough to fight with?
"Well you're here aren't you?"
"Uh, yes sir, I'll make sure I'll find my place here!"
"You're already here haha but alright let's move on."
"Hmm interesting, here we have mister Daniel Dillinger.”
  A tall guy with a hoodie came from his seat. Nothing seemed to be out of norm.
	“would you please take your hood off and present yourself to the class.”
	“Yeah my bad teach haha, my name is Daniel Dillenger and I possess earth magic.” 
Everybody was in silence as they realized that that guy is actually another demi-human. He seemed to be half human and half wolf of some sort.
	“Well… I can use the earth's rocks and projectiles and am interested in learning more about earth magic.”
	“We will definitely be learning a lot more about the laws of magic and what our limits are." replied Joshua as he sat at his desk behind the desk.
	“So, we do have limits sir?”
	“Man, what’s up with you kids and these ridiculous questions?"
            "Of course everyone and everything has its limits.”
Everyone stood watching as this simple conversation got intense.
            "Why do you ask?"
“No I was just asking because, then that would mean the more the limit a person can reach would let them determine what is justice and what is not?"
"Theoretically yes"
"However, you forgot about one thing added to that equation."
"And what would that be sir."
"A team."
"Yeah but still it's definitely a scary thought."
"There's a million other different ways you can possibly die, I would say watch out for the coconut trees before that haha.
"Coconut trees?"
"Hmm, I guess that's a way to go.
"Anything's possible but glad to have someone engaged with the class and asking questions."
"You may now take a seat Mr. Dillinger."
"Oh uh yes sir. "
"Wait, how can teammates alone go against who to say gods?", Phillip said confusingly.
“Gods?”
“Phillip you really want to learn how?”
“If there’s a way it could help right?”
“Well, yes but, ok.”
"By tipping the balance haha.
“Tipping the balance?”
“Yes you see, life is full of unpredictable events, some changing the way we live forever some ending legacies."
"Like this kingdom for instance."
"Everyone put their lives on the line to build this great city, and now it's the biggest kingdom in all of Naturia."
"Without everyone you see living in this city, there would be no city."
"The king treats everyone like family and keeps a cycle going that everyone goes by to keep us from falling behind.”
“He really is a great man.”
I really didn't notice her in the middle of the room.
	“Umm does that mean gods really are real?”says Marceline
	“God, a supreme being possessing powers over human fortune, if it was a real thing I am sure we would have seen something like that by now,” replies Prescilla Hemsworth
	“No, they are real as they come, beings that have the power of all authority haha,” Joshua says laughingly.
            "Haha, now you don't have to worry there hasn't been in contact with any of the gods in hundreds of years."
	“Still, it’s pretty daunting to know.” Phillip replied.
	“Well you guys asked”
“Next time try not to ask a question you’re not ready to hear haha”
	“Now we’re getting off topic, let us resume with her royal highness.”
“Miss Marceline please step and introduce yourself.”
	
“Hello you all, my name is Marceline Espinosa, brother to Vincent Espinosa, niece to your majesty, The king.”
Everyone was amazed that they got a chance to have two people of royalty in their class, even if one is a total jerk. She had black hair, purple like eyes and seemed very nice and was already gaining some respect from everyone. Assuming her entrance just now was the cause of it. I on the other hand thought she seemed really different. Delicate, almost like a flower, actually kind of cute in a way. It’s weird, this feeling inside was unidentifiable.
“My magic power allows me to predict someone’s next action”
“yes it is possible”
“Is that possible?” Jeison questioned.
“Woah how’d did you know I was going to say that”
“It was simple, and possibly the only way I can show you how it works as of now.
“That’s some very complex magic you got there Miss Marceline, looking forward to how it will be used.”
“Thank you sir, may I sit now.”
“Why of course”
“Ok, so next we have here is Megan Caprice.”
	She was known to be the most beautiful in our class. She was around 5’7 give or take and busty with a body on top of it all. 

	“Woah can’t wait to see what she can do!” yells Jeison.”
	“An essay must be turned in by you too Mr. Jeison.” 
	“Huh, aww ok sheesh.”
	“Now, you may resume.”
	“Thank you sir, now that we got past that, allow me to introduce myself.”
	“My name is Megan Caprice and I possess wind magic.”
	She then picked up a piece of paper and placed it flat on her hand. It began to float and spin over her hand.
	“wow I’m impressed I usually can’t hold it this long.
	Right after she said that the wind quickly started to pick up and got bigger, then dispersed across the class knocking everyone’s papers off their desks.
	“Yeah that usually happens, so far it’s very hard for me to control but I think I just need a bit more practice.
	The class was amazed how much force was demonstrated from just the air itself pushing against their bodies.
	“Haha, we have special equipment to help you practice your guy’s magic, and it’s always available 24 hours just make sure to return the key to the office after use.
	“You may go ahead and take a seat.”
	“who do we have next?”
	“Mister, Joell Monichar, go ahead, come up to the class and show us what you can do.”
	He was very tall and lean with short straight hair. The girls seem to like him. He never seemed engaged with the class until now.
	“Hey guys, I’m Joell and my power is to grow and shrink.”
	He then began to climb on top of the teachers desk, which at that point nothing was on it anymore. 
	“well I should of expected this 
	“Now watch as I shrink.”
Then he slowly began shrinking.
	“If I grew I would probably destroy the whole building hehehe,” Said with his high pitched voice.
	“aww that’s so cute!”
	“It’s adorable!
	“I want one!”
	The girls yelled as they thought he was the cutest thing on the market.
	“It looks like we have a popular one here,” Joshua says jokingly.
“Let’s continue this outside of class ok ladies”
“Joell then goes back to his normal size and jumps off the desk and back towards his desk making a graceful landing.”
Even I had to admit that was a pretty sweet landing.
“Hey, pretty neat landing man.” I waived
“Hmph.”, he ignored.
I soon realized how a total idiot he is.
“Now let us move on with the class shall we?”
“More than halfway done and next I have here is Miss Tea Marie.
“Uh excuse me sir It’s pronounced tay uh, it’s Téa marie sir.” she said as she made her way up.
She was one of the only girls that hasn’t talked yet. She was very short and seemed shy. She was wearing a garden hat and a white nightgown.
“Um, hello everyone I’m Téa.”
“Hello Téa.” the class replied.
“My magic power is light and my parents say it's very special.”
“I can do all sorts of things like glow in the dark or watch the sun.”
The class was quiet and seemed very bored considering its daylight and nobody wanted to watch her stare at the sun.
“oh I can do this.”
She then quickly moved to the door leaving a flash of light behind her.
“How did she do that?” Jeison said.
“Another one?” Vincent said.
I can travel at the speed of light but it’s very taxing on my mana and I can only during the day when the sun is out.
“Not bad I’m sure there’s many more things you can do you’re not aware of yet,” Joshua said.
“Really, like like what sir?”
“Well that’s for you to find out haha.”
“We’ll find out sooner or later, but for now, you may sit down now dear.”
“Ok sir haha”
“Ms Susie Baker you’re up next on our list, please come up.
“Hello everyone I’m Susie and I love all the powers everyone’s shown, very cool indeed.”
“While I don’t think mines anywhere as powerful as you guys I have the ability to summon earth spirits.”
She then put her hands out and recited some form of ancient chant. Soon after a large amount of mana bursted around her forming a ring. It disappeared and there we saw two small green plant-like creatures appearing from within thin air floating on both sides of her. They seemed to be made of some type of vegetation and a leaf was over their tiny heads to top it off. I thought it complimented them nicely.
“They are great for body guards and helpful to my garden in making things grow faster and riper.”
“The light green one is Gaea and this darker one over there is named Dionysus.”
“They’re both friendly for the most part, they just get upset when people try to talk to me haha, my best friends.”
She then pets them and after they make a high pitch pur-like noise. Actually, they seemed pretty neat.
“Oh, but I am also studying different types of potions I can make using what I grow from my garden as some of my materials.
“Wow boys, the girls got you beat with smartness and performance haha," Joshua said laughingly.
“Why of course we do sir haha.”
“Ok ok that’s enough haha you may take your seat now.”
“We have to move a bit quickly before lunch.”
"Ok next we have here is.. oh"
"Hmm Joseph Vene...."
"I'm already here.. ugh sir." He sighed 
It was the guy from earlier, the one who confessed his love to that Priscilla girl. If I remember correctly he doesn't  really see eye to eye with us demi-humans. And, if Uncle Joshua didn't show up during our little encounter we'd probably be expelled right now.
"Oh yes, right on time I presume."
Everyone seemed amazed he knew he was next. Some of us assumed he had prediction magic like Marceline but that's rare if it's own. This had to be different.
"Hello everyone, my name is Joseph Venerable and I have time travel magic.
“WHAAAAT!!!, THIS MAN’S CRAZY!” Jeison Screamed in excitement.
“Wow, maybe this might be interesting after all aha.” said Joshua
“I’m on his team!” Jeison interjected.
“Well so far I can only travel fifty seconds ahead and fifty seconds back,” Joseph explained.
I was confused on how that worked and what happened to his body.
“Let me show you guys what I mean, time travel is a bit tricky after all”
He then closes his eyes very deep in his thoughts, very calm and focus.
“Ok this is going to be funny aha.” 
He then stepped a few feet to the side of him. We waited and after thirty more seconds there appeared a black cloud. Out came Joseph.
“Hey Joseph, knock knock? Joseph’s clone said happily.
“Who’s there?”
“Joseph”
“Joseph who?”
“Joseph number 2 haha”
Both Josephs started laughing historically. But Noone can seem to find what was so funny.
“Ahem ah yes , but sadly your time limit is up now.
Poof, and there goes Joseph’s future self back to the not so distant past.
“I basically waited long enough for my future self to go back in time and demonstrate my powers now because the past is now the present.”
“Oh, and by the way I knew everything I was going to say. Haha, a lot of time to prepare.”

The class applauds in amazement. His enactment felt like I was watching a magic show. Those got old fast though. I don’t think it works well on himself or really gives a good idea.
“Wow, pretty cool indeed kid, We’ll have to toughen you up for close combat then hahaha,” Joshua said.
What?, I am tough!” Joseph replied in anger.”
What?, oh yeah sure you are my bad sir.”
He then clenches Joshua's arm in a manly grip.
“Don’t underestimate me,” He whispered to his face.
Joshua seemed to get lossed in his eyes as if he was caught in a trap.
“Hmm, you want to fight, kid?”
And with a dark stare from Joshua it felt as if the whole room got heavy.
“Tsk,” Joseph gasps.
Joseph then throws Joshua’s arm down.
“What do you know anyways.”
Joseph then returns to his seat with the class in mute.
We’ll let that be for now.

“OK, So, through data and statistics we came up with a preselected list constructed to be fair and square.”
“Phillip your team will be” 
“What, my team?” Phillip interjected
“Yes Phillip, this is only a test of everyone”s current skills, nothing more, nothing less,” Joshua explains.
“Now, Phillip your team shall consist of Susie, Zachary, Joseph, Daniel..”
“Please don’t pick me, Please don’t pick me, please don’t pick me,” Vincent mutters to himself.
“Vincent…”
“Aww.. ooh uh this will be easy, uhh.” Vincent says out loud as Joshua squints menacingly.
“and Marceline will all be on Team A.
I couldn’t help but smile. I now had a chance to talk to her, but I was a Demi-human and she’s royalty. There was definitely no way in a million years she would talk to me. But, as I was thinking, we locked eyes. All I could think is she caught me, and I must’ve looked away fast.
“Uh you’re so embarrassing phillip.” I said in my head.
“So, with those names being called out, the rest of you guys will be on the other team,” Joshua says.
“That means Priscilla, your team will have Suterusu, Megan, Téa, Alyssa, Joell, and Jeison, for Team B.”
“We will have you all get ready to spar after Lunch, need to check out the Staff here, I mean food.” Joseph coughs finishing his sentence.
“Now class is dismissed for lunch.”
Everyone got up for lunch. The place was huge and I almost got lost just getting to my class. Thankfully, they’ve mapped out the whole school and offer teleporting as a fee. I didn’t have much because Uncle Joshua put all my dad's money in a bank until I was an adult. And besides, I would rather walk anyway. Going out wasn’t my thing but, I admit the scenery was awe inspiring with tons of vegetation and animals to look at. There were different fruits I’ve never seen before. I wanted to soak up as much about this foreign land while I was here as I could.
“Beautiful isn’t it” Marceline said as she crept behind me.
There she was, walking beside me. One of the only ones, besides me and Joseph, who decided to walk instead of using a magic teleporter.  
“Ooh oh uuh you scared me haha but it's gorgeous!!” 
“Back home in my kingdom, we don’t have as many animals like this.”
“Oh, The Demi-Human Kingdom right?” Marceline says with a soft voice.
“Uh, yeah that’s right.” I said anxiously
Wasn’t sure if this was going to be the biggest blunder of my life. She then says to me.
“You see those furry creatures in that tree.”
“Uh, yeah right there,” I pointed.
“Yeah, those are called Cat-Monkeys, they’re my favorite animal,” Maceline says.
“I’ve never seen one before.”
I couldn’t help but stare and watch that baby cat-monkey be fed in the tree by its parents.
“Wonder if I could keep one”
“Oh no they’ll ruin your furniture, my father would never allow me to,” Marceline Says sadly.
“Your father sounds like a very honest man.”
“He is definitely a hard to impress guy, not particularly fond of Demis either if that’s what you’re getting at.”
“Oh haha, no I was saying he sounds like a great guy.”
She looked at me in distress followed by a deep breath and then smiled.
“My uncle would always tell me stories about the demi-kingdom .”
“Is that right, the king correct?
 “Yes!! He would tell me stories of how he once was saved by a demi himself and how most Demis are really kind hehe.” 
“He would always say, Marceline if you meet a demi make sure you treat him with kindness,” Marceline imitated in a deep raspy voice. 
“Haha your voice is way too light for that” I laughed.
 “You sound like you're gonna hurt yourself.”
“But um what else has he told you.”
“Well…” Marceline squints followed by a smile.
“He said I could be friends with anyone no matter the fur, or feathers.” She smiles.
“So, you want to be my friend then?”
“Is that a problem?”
“No not at all I just don’t really..”
“Understand,” Marceline added.
“Yeah, a pretty girl like you and a noble at that, wants to be friends with me?”
 “Sounds unheard of.”
“I see how my kingdom acts towards demi-humans and it makes me sick!” Marceline cried,
“Why can’t we get along, why do both of our kingdoms have to be Separated?”
“They’re afraid Marceline.” I concluded.
“Well, that’s just dumb, we’ve been talking for 10 minutes and I’m not afraid.”
“I’m not sure you’re like other people Marceline.”
“Well you may be right Phillip but dammit someone has to be,” Marceline replies.
“Then how about I be the first then, and show even a noble could be friends with a ''Demi ``.''
I thought she was crazy. Why me is all I could think. Why would she choose me and why now? I’m sure I’m not the first demi-human she’s met. Or, maybe I was, she is the King’s niece after all. I’m sure she has been put in a lot of protection.

“You’re still wondering why you, aren’t you?” Marceline asks as I’m dozing off.
“It’s just that you’re”
“Phillip, Iwant to know your world, just like how  you wanted to learn about mine.”
Things started to be more clear after. She just wanted something different than what she was used to. I wonder exactly how long were they keeping her locked up for? Did she ever have a friend?
“I’m sure you have other friends”
“Won’t they feel awkward around me?”
“I never had a friend, just me and my brother.”
“We would study and stay on our best behavior, our parents' pride and joy.”
“Sounds.. interesting.”
“Well then sure let’s do it, let's be friends!” I insisted.
“Really?” Marceline asks.
“Yes really”
 “This is going to be so cool you have to tell me everything you know!” Marceline said excitedly.
“Haha no problem I’m a Demi-Professional.” I teased.
 “But wait, are you going to eat?” I interjected.
“I packed my own lunch, see.” Marceline repeated.
She then shows me a Gold Container containing hot food. Some I’ve never known could even come in that color.
“How about you, are you eating?” Marceline asks.
“I packed my own lunch as well.”
It was just a sandwich with lemon-apple and pomegranate juice.
“This is what you guys eat?”
“Now, I know it doesn't look appetising but this is my favorite…”
“Can I try?”
“Uh, sure..”
We chopped it up all lunch as we ate in the school park that day.  She taught me the names of the different foods she had. She even pointed out some animals. I couldn't believe it, the only animals I would rarely see are squirrel-bats and Mosquito-flies. My dad would always say it’s so beautiful here and couldn’t wait for me to see. Man, who would've known the first person I would become friends with in the Human Society is a human. Let alone a girl at that. Well, I couldn’t complain. And, with that we walked back together as if we’ve known each other for forever. 

Scrimmage Match

She decided to walk back with me to class and from all our talking we forgot the time and was almost late for class. We made it back to class just in time. While we were walking up to the door together, people started to whisper to each other. It’s kind of hard not noticing when everyone is literally doing it.
“Woah, looky here Demi and the noble girl are getting buddy buddy!” yells Jesion from in line.
Everyone was lined up waiting for the doors to class to open from lunch. However, before that Vincent walks up.
“Get away from her!” Vincent screams as he pulls Marceline away from me.
“Ouch Vincent that hurted!” yells Marceline.
“Hey dude what’s your problem you’ve had a bone to pick up with me ever  since I’ve walked in this place.” I said angrily.
“Shut up everyone knows demi-humans are demons!”
“If you touch my sister again next time I’ll kill you.” Vincent said with intent.
Vincent is then slapped hard in the face.You could hear it’s impact echo through the hallways. Everyone became shocked to find out the person who slapped him was Marceline herself.
“Marceline you just slapped me,” Vincent said stunned.
He looked confused as if he’d seen a ghost.
“You are literally the rudest person I know Vincent, this man is my friend so leave us alone!”
“Friend?”
Vincent's attitude changed for a split second. For a quick glimpse I swore I could see a smile form on his face. Until he quickly wiped it off and said, “Well, if you ever hurt her I will kill you, and that’s a promise.
“You have my word she will be safe with me.” I declared.
“Hmph, I’m going somewhere else it stinks over here.”
As he walked away everyone quickly looked the other way.
“What are you all looking at, grr!” Vincent yelled.
“Sorry, my brother is really protective of me, but even I have never seen him act so reckless.”
Either way I’m sure we would never become friends after that. He’s way too careless. At Least I think so.
“Don’t worry about it, it’s no big deal.”
“uh ok.” Marceline smiles.
“They’re really getting close,”  Megan whispers to Susie.
“Yeah I think it’s kind of cute hehe,” Susie replies
“Alright class you guys can turn around, we’ll be doing our scrimmage match in a more suitable environment.” Joseph yells as he walks from down the hall.
“That makes sense but where will we go, there’s tons of trees and everything looks so nice.” Prescilla asks as she writes in her notes.
“Good question, follow me in class.”
We walked outside to a small wooden shed. It looked well maintained but could probably fit at most 3 people.
“So how are we supposed to fight in this; I’m not being stuffed in there with a bunch of guys?” Jesion says frantically.
“Hasn’t anyone ever taught you don’t judge a book by its cover?” Joseph asks
“Now go ahead and go inside; You guys can follow him.” 
“Alright but if I don’t like where this is going i'm leaving.” Jeison declared.
“Haha just take a look will you.”
Jeison opens the door to the empty shed and as he walks in his body disappears.
“Hey guys come check this out!” Jesion yells as he pops his head out.
It was a huge arena with about 3 acres of land and the height was around 120 feet. It had small lake, forest, dessert and winter sections surrounding what seemed to be a circular field.
